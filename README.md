# Flask-Application-Login-Page
This code is a Flask web application that allows users to create accounts. The application uses SQLite as the database and includes the necessary functions to handle database connections, errors, and queries. The main functionality of the application is the ability for users to create accounts by submitting a form with their first name, last name, email, password, and confirmation of password. If the passwords match and the email does not already exist in the database, a new user is added to the database with a timestamp of when the account was created. The application also includes error handling and displays success or error messages to the user.
